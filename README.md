# GTM-Tag-Templates_async-script-loader-with-callback-function
A GTM custom template that loads an async script and upon successfully doing so executes a callback function that pushes an event of your choice to the dataLayer.

# How to import this custom template tag into you GTM container
1. Download the .tpl file you will find in this repository
2. Browse to the templates section in your Google Tag Manager container. 
3. Click on the 'New' button within the 'Tag Templates' section.
4. Click on the three dots on the top right corner of the screen and import the .tpl file.

#How to use this custom template
Once you have uploaded the .tpl file to you Google Tag Manager container, it is important that you update the 'Permissions' in order to authorize the tag template to call and inject files from the hostname and path you decide.
